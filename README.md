# 496-final
 This repository serves as my final project for the Fall 2022 offering of CAS LX496, the Computational Linguistics course at Boston University.

 In this course, we learned much about the existing mechanisms for computational linguistics in Python, such as the NLTK corpora as well as many other packages that help with processing linguistic/language data.

 I hope to build upon these lessons by creating a "translator" that takes your input and outputs a word or sentence that emulates a certain author's writing style.

 This repository will include the files I have worked on from November to December of 2022.
